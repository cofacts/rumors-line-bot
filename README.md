## Development

Developing rumors-line-bot requires you to finish the following settings.

### LINE@ account & Developer accounts

Please follow all the steps in [LINE official tutorial](https://developers.line.me/messaging-api/getting-started).

### Environment variables

Create `.env` file from `.env.sample` template, at least fill in:
```
API_URL=https://cofacts-api.g0v.tw/graphql
LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET=<paste LINE@'s channel secret here>
LINE_CHANNEL_TOKEN=<paste LINE@'s channel token here>
LIFF_URL=<paste LIFF app's LiFF URL>
```

Other customizable env vars are:

* `REDIS_URL`: If not given, `redis://127.0.0.1:6379` is used.
* `PORT`: Which port the line bot server will listen at.
* `GOOGLE_DRIVE_IMAGE_FOLDER`: Google drive folder id is needed when you want to test uploading image.
* `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`: will be populated by `authGoogleDrive.js`. See "Upload image/video" section below.
* `GA_ID`: Google analytics universal analytics tracking ID, for tracking events
* `IMAGE_MESSAGE_ENABLED`: Default disabled. To enable, please see "Process image message" section below.
* `DEBUG_LIFF`: Disables external browser check in LIFF. Useful when debugging LIFF in external browser. Don't enable this on production.

### Redis server

We use Redis to store conversation context / intents. Please run a Redis server on your machine, or use the Heroku Redis's `REDIS_URL` directly if you happen to deploy the bot to Heroku.

### Node Dependencies

You will need `Node.JS` 12+  to proceed.

```
$ npm i
```

### Get the bot server running on your local machine

```
$ npm run dev
```

and the server will be started on `localhost:5001`. (Or the `PORT` you specified in your `.env` file.)

### Get LINE messages to your local machine

We recommend [using `ngrok`](https://medium.com/@Oskarr3/developing-messenger-bot-with-ngrok-5d23208ed7c8#.csc8rum8s) to create a public address that directs the traffic from LINE server to your local machine. With `ngrok` in your path, just

```
$ ngrok http 5001
```

`ngrok` will give you a public URL. Use this to set the webhook URL of your Channel (See the section "Channel Console" in [LINE official tutorial](https://developers.line.me/messaging-api/getting-started)).

We recommend using [ngrok configuration file](https://ngrok.com/docs#config) to setup a tunnel with a fixed `subdomain`. In this way the public URL can be fixed (means no repeatitive copy-pasting to LINE Channel settings!) as long as the `subdomain` is not occupied by others.

### LIFF setup

We are using LIFF to collect user's reason when submitting article & negative feedbacks.

If you don't need to develop LIFF, you can directly use `LIFF_URL` provided in `.env.sample`, which links to staging LIFF site.

If you want to modify LIFF, you may need to follow these steps:

#### Creating your own LIFF app

To create LIFF apps, please follow instructions under [official document](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/getting-started/), which involves
- Creating a LINE login channel
- Select `chat_message.write` in scope (for LIFF to send messages)
After acquiring LIFF URL, place it in `.env` as `LIFF_URL`.
- Set `Endpoint URL` to start with your chabbot endpoint, and add `/liff/index.html` as postfix.

#### Developing LIFF

To develop LIFF, after `npm run dev`, it is accessible under `/liff/index.html` of dev server (http://localhost:5001) or production chatbot server.

In development mode, it spins a webpack-dev-server on `localhost:<LIFF_DEV_PORT>` (default to `8080`),
and `/liff` of chatbot server proxies all requests to the webpack-dev-server.

A tip to develop LIFF in browser is:
1. trigger LIFF in the mobile phone
2. Get LIFF token from dev server proxy log (something like `GET /liff/index.html?p=<page>&token=<jwt> proxy to -> ...`)
3. Visit `https://<your-dev-chatbot.ngrok.io>/liff/index.html?p=<page>&token=<jwt>` in desktop browser for easier development

`liff.init()` would still work in desktop browser, so that the app renders, enabling us to debug web layouts on desktop.
`liff.sendMessages()` would not work, though.

#### How LIFF is deployed on production

On production, LIFF files are compiled to `/liff` directory and served as static files by the chatbot server.

If you get `400 bad request` in LIFF, please search for `liff.init` function call in compiled JS binary and see
if LIFF ID is consistent with your LIFF URL, which should be the path without leading `https://liff.line.me/`.

The LIFF ID is set using Webpack Define plugin during build,
thus swapping LIFF URL env variable without rebuilding the LIFF binaries will cause 400 bad request.

### Process image message(using Tesseract-OCR)

[Install tesseract-ocr binary](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki) and set `IMAGE_MESSAGE_ENABLED` to `true`. If you are going to deploy linebot on heroku, you should [use buildpack](https://github.com/cofacts/rumors-line-bot#tesseract-ocr-on-heroku).

Note : Linebot will temporarily save both image and tesseract output file in `tmp_image_process` folder every time image message sends in. If you develop through `npm run dev`, you should set `autorestart` and `watch` in ecosystem.dev.config.js to false.

### Upload image/video

First, follow the step1 in this [url](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/nodejs) to get `client_secret.json` and save it to project root.

Second, run:

```
$ node authGoogleDrive.js
```

Visit the given url provided above. Get the auth code and paste it to console.
Then the program will save your google drive access_token locally at `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` in `.env`.

Make sure you've also set `GOOGLE_DRIVE_IMAGE_FOLDER` = [folderID](https://googleappsscriptdeveloper.wordpress.com/2017/03/04/how-to-find-your-google-drive-folder-id/) in .env file.

[OAuth2 Protocols](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)

[Googleapi Nodejs Client](https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client)   P.S. This page provide the newest api usage then [this](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/nodejs).

### Translation

We use [ttag](https://ttag.js.org/) to support build-time i18n for the chatbot.

Please refer to ttag documentation for [annotating strings to translate](https://ttag.js.org/docs/quickstart.html).

To extract annotated strings to translation files, use:

```
$ npm run i18n:extract
```

#### Translation files

The translation files are located under `i18n/`, in [Gettext PO format](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html).

- `en_US.po`: Since the language used in code is already English, this empty translation file exists to simplify settings.
- `zh_TW.po`: Traditional Chinese translation.

#### Supporting other languages

You can replace this with [any language](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Names.html) you want to support, by leveraging Gettext [`msginit` command](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/msginit-Invocation.html).

You will need to change `i18n:extract` and `i18n:validate` script in `package.json` to reflect the locale change.

#### Building in different languages

By default, the chatbot will be built under `en_US` locale.

On Heroku, please set `LOCALE` to one of `en_US`, `zh_TW` or any other language code that exists under `i18n/` directory.

If you want to build using docker instead, you may need to modify Dockerfile to include the desired `LOCALE`.

#### Notification setup
Prequest : [LIFF setup](https://github.com/cofacts/rumors-line-bot#liff-setup)

You may set up a setting page entry point(`/liff/index.html?p=setting`) in [account manager](https://manager.line.biz/account/) -> rich menu

- To use [push message](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#send-push-message) :
  in .env file, sets `NOTIFY_METHOD=PUSH_MESSAGE`

- To use [line notify](https://notify-bot.line.me/en/) :
  1. You should first [register a service](https://notify-bot.line.me/my/services/).
  2. Then sets up `Callback Url` : `RUMORS_LINE_BOT_URL`/authcallback/line_notify
  3. in .env file, sets
      ```
      LINE_NOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<paste LINE Notify Client ID here>
      LINE_NOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<paste LINE Notify Client Secret here>
      NOTIFY_METHOD=LINE_NOTIFY
      RUMORS_LINE_BOT_URL=<line bot server url>
      ```

## Production Deployment

If you would like to start your own LINE bot server in production environment, this section describes how you can deploy the line bot to your own Heroku account.

### Get the server running

You can deploy the line bot server to your own Heroku account by [creating a Heroku app and push to it](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remote).

Despite the fact that we don't use `Procfile`, Heroku still does detection and installs the correct environment for us.

### Provision add-on "Heroku Redis"

[Provision a Heroku Redis addon](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis) to get redis. It sets the env var `REDIS_URL` for you.

### Tesseract-ocr on heroku

[Install heroku tesseract buildpack](https://github.com/cofacts/heroku-buildpack-tesseract) and set var `IMAGE_MESSAGE_ENABLED` to `true`.

### Configurations

You will still have to set the following config vars manually:

```
$ heroku config:set API_URL=https://cofacts-api.g0v.tw/graphql
$ heroku config:set SITE_URL=https://cofacts.g0v.tw
$ heroku config:set LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET=<Your channel secret>
$ heroku config:set LINE_CHANNEL_TOKEN=<Your channel token>
$ heroku config:set GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=<Your google credential (optional)>
$ heroku config:set LIFF_URL=<LIFF URL>
$ heroku config:set IMAGE_MESSAGE_ENABLED=true
$ heroku config:set MONGODB_URI=<MONGODB URI>
```
